                  in my Management of Technological Organizations course in Fall 2023, 
                  during which we designed an app called Safe Munchies. This project 
                  spanned the entire semester and involved four stages.

                <p>The objective of the project was to develop and design an IT 
                  solution to a problem. Our focus area was healthcare. We came up with 
                  a specific problem rationale after one of our members talked about how 
                  he is allergic to eggs. Ultimately, we chose to solve the 
                  inconveniences that people with food allergies and dietary 
                  restrictions face when going out to eat. We developed a prototype app, 
                  conducted research and interviews, and took note of our progress using 
                  a Gantt chart.

                  I had the role of Prototype Developer which I shared with another 
                  member. We worked together to create the Safe Munchies app but also 
                  had other duties to balance out the team’s workload. We brainstormed 
                  ideas for the app and I designed it and made it functional using 
                  Figma. I also used Adobe Illustrator to design the logo of the app.

                </div>
                <i>"With Safe Munchies, you can be safe and sound with the best snacks around."</i>
                <p>
                  Each year in the US, it is estimated that severe allergic reactions 
                  affect about 90,000 Americans a year. The app shows restaurants in 
                  the area of Rutgers and filters through their menus to find items 
                  the user can eat. Safe Munchies works via compiling data from online 
                  spreadsheets of ingredients in menu items and filtering it based on 
                  the needs of the user. It’s a low cost option considering RU express 
                  already lists restaurants in the area, this would just be a step up 
                  in helping those with food allergies and intolerances. It would be a 
                  showcase of Rutgers commitment to accessibility for their students, 
                  allowing those with dietary restrictions the ability to enjoy the 
                  restaurants around campus with their friends without feeling excluded.

                <p>
                  Our stakeholders are RU (Rutgers University) dining services. They 
                  manage the university's restaurants and dining halls, so they are the 
                  most suitable organization to engage with regarding this creative app 
                  idea. Another key stakeholder is the restaurants that surround the 
                  Rutgers area.
                  <br><br>
                  The customers are first-year Rutgers students due to dining plan 
                  requirements and others with nutritional disabilities.
                  <br><br>
                  We believe that they will have open ears in regard to our pitch and in making this app a success. As well as the customers will have high interesting paying for our app
