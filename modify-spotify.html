                <p>Our goal was to develop a platform specifically designed for college students, 
                    facilitating task management and time organization for optimum efficiency, with 
                    the aim of helping students enhance productivity and reduce academic stress.

                <p>People's work efficiency and time management often suffer due to constant distractions. 
                    Many college students struggle to effectively manage their workload, often due to limited 
                    time or competing priorities in their lives.

                <p>College students frequently juggle many courses, assignments, and 
                    extracurricular activities in today’s fast-paced academic environment, 
                    making efficient time management critical. The rise of digital 
                    distractions, like social networking and entertainment, has made 
                    it even more difficult to stay focused on assignments. 
                    Furthermore, the transition to online learning as a result of the 
                    COVID-19 pandemic has blurred the lines between personal and academic 
                    life, making it more difficult to keep a disciplined schedule. To 
                    address these difficulties, a tool that supports college students 
                    in effectively managing their time and avoiding distractions is 
                    required to boost their productivity and academic performance.
