        <p>Our goal was to develop a platform specifically designed for college students,
          facilitating task management and time organization for optimum efficiency, with
          the aim of helping students enhance productivity and reduce academic stress.

          <h5>Problem</h5>
        </div>
        <p>People's work efficiency and time management often suffer due to constant distractions.
          Many college students struggle to effectively manage their workload, often due to limited
          time or competing priorities in their lives.

          <h5>Context</h5>
        </div>
        <p>College students frequently juggle many courses, assignments, and
          extracurricular activities in today’s fast-paced academic environment,
          making efficient time management critical. The rise of digital
          distractions, like social networking and entertainment, has made
          it even more difficult to stay focused on assignments.
          Furthermore, the transition to online learning as a result of the
          COVID-19 pandemic has blurred the lines between personal and academic
          life, making it more difficult to keep a disciplined schedule. To
          address these difficulties, a tool that supports college students
          in effectively managing their time and avoiding distractions is
          required to boost their productivity and academic performance.

          <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <p>To address the problem of college students struggling with time management
          and distractions, we propose the development of a mobile app called
          'StudyMate.' StudyMate is a comprehensive platform designed specifically
          for college students to enhance productivity, improve time management,
          and reduce academic stress. The app will provide a range of features to
          help students stay organized, focused, and on top of their academic
          responsibilities.

          <h5>App Vs. Website</h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          In terms of our platform, both a mobile app and a web app would be
          efficient, considering that more people carry cell phones with them more
          often than laptops. However, many students also complete assignments on
          their laptops. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, our prototype will
          focus on creating our platform through a mobile app.

        <i>Gathering Data</i>
        <p>
          Our data collection plan involves interviews and a survey to gain insights
          into students' task prioritization, work-life balance, and reasons for
          procrastination. The interview covers three topics, including task
          prioritization, work-life balance, and reasons for procrastination, with
          five questions each. The survey consists of 15 questions, addressing
          employment status, screen time, weekly free time, class workload
          perceptions, health issues, work organization methods, productivity,
          stress levels, and difficulty remembering deadlines. The approach aims to
          provide a thorough understanding of students' academic experiences and
          challenges.
        </p>
        <br>
        <i>Analyzing Data</i>
        <p>
          In these interviews, students consistently prioritize classes based on
          major or personal interest, with the difficulty of the subject and
          relevance to future goals influencing their choices. Balancing academic
          commitments and free time poses challenges for many, prompting the use of
          various strategies like time management and setting boundaries.
          Procrastination emerges as a shared obstacle, negatively impacting academic
          performance through missed deadlines and increased stress. Canvas is
          basically the only way for them to track their assignments. Personal values
          and long-term goals play a crucial role in shaping individuals' approaches
          to studies and work-life balance. Seeking help and maintaining a diverse
          set of coping strategies are recognized as important factors in managing
          workload and overcoming challenges. Overall, while experiences vary, these
          interviews showcase common themes in students' academic journeys.

          <h5>The Prototype</h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          I was tasked with creating the prototype of StudyMate and chose to use
          Figma to develop it. Below is the design of our mobile application. Based
          on the responses from our questionnaires, we decided to make it an app that
          would request access to Canvas (a popular Learning Management System for
          colleges and universities). How is this different from other productivity
          apps? We emphasize social interactions. Social media is very prevalent in
          young adults. We planned to make social interactions compatible with all
          institutions. Users could add college students from different institutions
          as “friends” which opens up several many social interactions to occur
          between them. While the app itself will send notification reminders to
          complete assignments, friends can also trigger notification reminders. A
          reminder from a friend can be more meaningful than an automatic reminder.
